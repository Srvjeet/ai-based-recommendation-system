# ai-based-recommendation-system
For a business without any user-item purchase history, a search engine based recommendation system can be designed for users. The product recommendations can be based on textual clustering analysis given in product description.
This works best if a business is setting up its e-commerce website for the first time and does not have user-item purchase/rating history to start with initally.
This recommendation system will help the users get a good recommendation to start with and once the buyers have a purchased history,
the recommendation engine can use the model based collaborative filtering technique.
